## Technology Stack

### Django
- **Purpose**: A high-level Python web framework used to build the backend logic, RESTful/GraphQL APIs, and handle user authentication and authorization.

### MySQL
- **Purpose**: A relational database management system for storing and managing structured data, such as user profiles, property listings, and booking transactions.

### GraphQL
- **Purpose**: A query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, improving efficiency and flexibility compared to traditional REST APIs.

### Docker
- **Purpose**: A containerization platform used to create isolated environments for development, testing, and deployment, ensuring consistency across all stages of the project.

### GitHub Actions
- **Purpose**: A CI/CD tool integrated with GitHub to automate workflows, including testing, code quality checks, and deployment to cloud platforms.
