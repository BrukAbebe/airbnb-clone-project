## üóÉÔ∏è Database Design

### Entities & Relationships

1. **Users**
   - Fields: `id`, `username`, `email`, `password_hash`, `created_at`
   - Relationships: One user ‚Üí Many properties, bookings, reviews.

2. **Properties**
   - Fields: `id`, `title`, `price`, `location`, `host_id` (FK to Users)
   - Relationships: One property ‚Üí Many bookings, reviews.

3. **Bookings**
   - Fields: `id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `user_id` (FK to Users), `property_id` (FK to Properties)
   - Relationships: Belongs to one user and one property.

4. **Reviews**
   - Fields: `id`, `rating`, `comment`, `user_id` (FK to Users), `property_id` (FK to Properties)
   - Relationships: Belongs to one user and one property.

5. **Payments**
   - Fields: `id`, `amount`, `status`, `booking_id` (FK to Bookings), `user_id` (FK to Users)
   - Relationships: Linked to a booking and user.

## üõ†Ô∏è Feature Breakdown

### User Management
- Allows registration, login, and profile updates. Ensures secure access to the platform.

### Property Management
- Hosts can list properties with details like price and location. Core to the marketplace model.

### Booking System
- Users reserve properties for specific dates. Manages availability and conflicts.

### Payment Processing
- Integrates with payment gateways (e.g., Stripe) to handle transactions securely.

### Review System
- Builds trust via user-generated reviews and ratings for properties.

## üîí API Security

### Key Measures
1. **Authentication**: JWT tokens to verify user identity.
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access (e.g., only hosts can edit properties).
3. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent API abuse (e.g., 100 requests/minute).
4. **HTTPS**: Encrypt data in transit.
5. **Input Validation**: Sanitize user inputs to prevent SQL injection.

### Importance
- **User Data**: Protect sensitive info like emails and passwords.
- **Payments**: Prevent fraud with encrypted transactions.
- **Availability**: Ensure APIs remain responsive under load.

## üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automate code testing on every commit.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Deploy validated code to production automatically.

### Tools Used
- **GitHub Actions**: Run tests, lint code, and deploy.
- **Docker**: Ensure consistency across environments.
- **AWS/Heroku**: Cloud platforms for deployment.

### Why It Matters
- **Faster Releases**: Automate repetitive tasks.
- **Fewer Errors**: Catch bugs early in development.
- **Scalability**: Easily deploy updates to handle growing traffic.
